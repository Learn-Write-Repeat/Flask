Really one of the above.                                                                                                                                            
We all see lots of forms in our daily life. Some of them are offline and some are online. But in this topic, we are talking about **WEB FORM** which is a online type of form.

## 👍Introduction to FORM

**Forms are used to collect the required information in a logical, meaningful fashion for communication and pass to another entity.**

#### 🤷‍♂️WHY WE NEED WEB FORM?

As we know that templates are unidirectional, which means they allow information to flow from the server to the user. For most applications,however, there is also a need to have information that flows in the other direction,
with the user providing data that the server accepts and processes.For that we create Web Forms where users can enter information.
The form data is then submitted by the web browser to the server, typically in the form of a POST request.

The Flask request object exposes all the information sent by the client in a request and, in particular for POST requests containing form data, provides access to the user information through request.form.
Although the support provided in Flask’s request object is sufficient for the handling of web forms, there are a number of tasks that can become tedious and repetitive.
Two good examples are the generation of HTML code for the forms and the validation of the submitted form data.
